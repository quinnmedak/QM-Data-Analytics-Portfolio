## Project Highlights and Personal Growth
This project challenged me because the given data did not lead to many diffinitive answers hypothetically asked by a business. This reflects the importance of interpreting statistics precisely rather than forcing data to answer business questions when more information or data is required. Additionally, I needed to transform quantitative variables into categorical ones in order to visualize them, and doing so taught me small shortcuts used in transformation.
